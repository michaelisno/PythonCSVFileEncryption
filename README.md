Info
----
Python csv file encryption/decryption program<br>
This program will decrypt an encrypted file into csv format on memory and then re-encrypt to disk.<br>
- Hence the csv data is only editable through the program.<br>
This program encrypts using the file's meta data, so copies are not decryptable - only the original file.<br>
The entire file is encrypted but each row is also encrypted with its own key and additional row-unique data.<br>

Example
-------
The example file key is 'password'<br>
Row '0's key is 'yes'
